## Overview
This project contains a collection of Python programs generated by ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a natural language processing model trained by OpenAI that can generate human-like text in response to input prompts.

The projects are mostly 1 or 2 files maximum because ChatGPT excels at solving small problem and is not yet ready for full team-based projects

<sub>For extra spice, the README was also mostly generated by ChatGPT</sub>


*A lot of projects ideas were used from [This repository](https://github.com/karan/Projects)*
